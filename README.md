# TimeSeries-Anomaly-Detection
TimeSeries Anomaly Detection is a machine learning project focused on detecting anomalies in synthetic multivariate time series data. The project generates a large dataset (over 1 GB) of system metrics, applies a simple anomaly detection algorithm, and visualizes both the detected anomalies and their distribution across different features.

# TimeSeries Anomaly Detection

## üöÄ Overview
**TimeSeries Anomaly Detection** is a project that demonstrates the generation, analysis, and visualization of anomalies in synthetic multivariate time series data. The workflow involves:
1. Generating synthetic time series data of system metrics (e.g., CPU temperature, memory usage).
2. Detecting anomalies using a basic unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm.
3. Visualizing the results through time-series plots and summary statistics.

This project can serve as a foundation for developing and testing advanced anomaly detection algorithms or for understanding data preprocessing, anomaly detection, and visualization techniques.

üí° Key Concepts
Multivariate Time Series Data: Represents multiple system metrics (e.g., CPU temperature, memory usage) over time.
Anomaly Detection: Identifies outliers or unusual patterns in data that deviate significantly from the norm.
Isolation Forest Algorithm: An unsupervised algorithm used to detect anomalies in high-dimensional datasets.

‚ú® Future Improvements
Implement advanced anomaly detection techniques (e.g., LSTM Autoencoders or Variational Autoencoders).
Add support for real-time anomaly detection.
Extend visualization to include heatmaps or correlation analysis
