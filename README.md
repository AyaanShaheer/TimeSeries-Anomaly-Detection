# TimeSeries-Anomaly-Detection
TimeSeries Anomaly Detection is a machine learning project focused on detecting anomalies in synthetic multivariate time series data. The project generates a large dataset (over 1 GB) of system metrics, applies a simple anomaly detection algorithm, and visualizes both the detected anomalies and their distribution across different features.
